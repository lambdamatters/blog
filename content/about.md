We â™¥ Haskell, and Functional Programming.

But how did this come about in the first place ?

Well, we too started out programming in C, C++, & Java with a bit of scripting languages here and there. But our secret passion lay in LISP & its dialects like Scheme, to which we got introduced by the legendary Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.

Our own experience with imperative followed by object-oriented programming, and the recent work with huge amounts of JavaScript frameworks got us convinced that Functional Programming was the way to go. We began to extensively adopt as well as advocate tool-belts like underscore.js & lodash that facilitate a functional style of programming, and achieved great results in terms of modularity, simplicity, compactness, and ultimately correctness! Naturally, we began to crave for "more" of this experience, and began to wonder if it would be possible to take a deeper plunge into this amazing world.

Thus began our hunt for the "right choice" of a Programming Language through which to understand the best of this rock-solid paradigm that took birth with Lambda Calculus. We had various languages to choose from, beginning with the myriad dialects of LISP itself, to the ubiquitous JavaScript which was going through various revisions & typed variants like TypeScript, to some recent languages like Standard ML, Scala, Clojure, OCaml, etc. But before long, we had settled upon Haskell as our unanimous choice due to obvious reasons, and the rest is History -- in the making!

Our passion for teaching in general, and programming in particular has led to various workshops & trainings both within our organizations as well as in developer communities.
